### SPA-shell-demo
Short **plain vanilla js** example that demonstrates a persistent left nav bar and some css3 usage for creating
DOM nodes using json data

### Goal
Create a web interface that helps showcase some basic elements of a 'SPA' shell.

### How to run
This can be easily run locally even with a SimpleHTTPServer on the mac as follow.
Or alternatively use the 'web server for chrome' app.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/bganguly/SPA-shell-demo.git
$ cd SPA-shell-demo/src
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8889
```
[go to localhost](http://localhost:8889/index.html)
